# Prerequisites
Use this tutorial to quickly set up your system so you can dive into using the Find-a-gig API.

These steps take about 30 minutes.

Before using the Find-a-gig API, do the following:

1. Set up a GitHub account.
2. Ensure your development system is running a current operating system.
3. Download or verify installation of the following software:
    * Git (for the command line)
    * GitHub Desktop (optional)
    * A fork of the Find-a-gig repo
    * A current/LTS version of node.js
    * A current version of json-server
    * A current copy of the database file. You can get this by syncing your fork.  
     **TIP:** If you're using a fork of the repo, create a working branch in which to do your tutorials. Create a new branch for each tutorial to prevent a mistake in one from affecting your work in another.
    * The Postman desktop app. Because you run the To-Do service on your development system with an http://localhost hostname, the web-version of Postman can't perform the exercises.
