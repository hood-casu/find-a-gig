# FAQs

## Do I need to pay to use this service?

Nope! This API is meant to be a mock service for documentation education. There are no plans to make this service require payment for use.

## Why don't I need to authenticate to use the service?

See the answer to the above question.This service is purely for educational purposes for now. There is no information in the API database that is privileged and would require authentication.

## What if I want to take a break from gigs?

No worries! You can set your profile gig preferences to account for that. Use the [Change a musician profile](tutorials/change-a-musician-profile/) tutorial to change your `long_term_gig` and `short-term-gig` preferences to `false`. You can change it one to `true` later when you are ready to gig again.

## I moved, but I still want to take gigs where I am now. What do I do?

Use the [Change a musician profile](tutorials/change-a-musician-profile/) tutorial to change your profile `location` value to your new area.

## Who should use this service?

* Gigging musicians looking for long-term or short-term gigs.
* Musicians looking for another musician to gig with.
* Bandmates looking for a last minute musician to fill-in.
* Vocalists who need a backup band for a gig.
* Event organizers looking for talent.
* And many more!

## I play two difference instruments. Why can't I put two instruments in my profile?

This is a feature that may be added to the API later. For now, you can add two different profiles. Use the [Add an instrumentalist profile](tutorials/add-an-inst-profile/) or [Add a vocalist profile](tutorials/add-a-vocalist-profile/) if you would like to add another.

## Can I make my own user interface with this service integrated?

Sure! As mentioned elsewhere, this API is a mock service and is free to use.
